Connectivity provides network monitoring capabilities for multiplatform projects. It can monitor
network connectivity using native APIs on Android and Apple devices, or by making HTTP requests to
specified hosts.

## Setup

Add the following dependencies to your project, depending on the platform you are targeting.

```toml
[versions]
connectivity = "1.0.0"

[libraries]
connectivity-core = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-core", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-device = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-device", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-android = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-android", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-apple = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-apple", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-http = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-http", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-compose = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-compose", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-compose-device = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-compose-device", version.ref = "connectivity" }
connectivity-compose-http = { module = "dev.jordond.connectivity:connectivity-compose-http", version.ref = "connectivity" }
```

### Single Platform

Here is an example of how to add the dependencies to a single platform project targeting Android:

```kotlin
dependencies {
  implementation(libs.connectivity.core)
  implementation(libs.connectivity.android)

  // For compose support
  implementation(libs.connectivity.compose.device)
}
```

### Multiplatform - Device

Here is an example of how to add the dependencies to a multiplatform project that targets both
Android and Apple devices:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
          implementation(libs.connectivity.core)
          implementation(libs.connectivity.device)

          // For compose support
          implementation(libs.connectivity.compose.device)
        }
    }
}
```

### All supported platforms

Here is an example of how to add the dependencies to a multiplatform project that targets all the
supported platforms.
It uses the `connectivity-device` for mobile targets, and `connectivity-http` for the rest:

```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        commonMain.dependencies {
          implementation(libs.connectivity.core)

          // For compose support
          implementation(libs.connectivity.compose)
        }

        val deviceMain by creating {
            dependsOn(commonMain.get())
            androidMain.get().dependsOn(this)
            appleMain.get().dependsOn(this)
            dependencies {
              implementation(libs.connectivity.device)

              // For compose support
              implementation(libs.connectivity.compose.device)
            }
        }

        val httpMain by creating {
            dependsOn(commonMain.get())
            jvmMain.get().dependsOn(this)
            jsMain.get().dependsOn(this)
            wasmJsMain.get().dependsOn(this)
            dependencies {
              implementation(libs.connectivity.http)

              // For compose support
              implementation(libs.connectivity.compose.http)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

See the [demo](demo) project for a complete example.

## Usage

Basic usage of Connectivity is simple, you just need an instance of the `Connectivity` object, then
you can observe the network connectivity.

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity()
connectivity.start()
coroutineScope.launch {
  connectivity.statusUpdates.collect { status ->
    when (status) {
      is NetworkStatus.Connected -> println("Connected to network")
      is NetworkStatus.Disconnected -> println("Disconnected from network")
    }
  }
}
```

You can also get the current connectivity status by invoking the suspended `status()` function:

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity()
coroutineScope.launch {
    val status = connectivity.status()
    when (status) {
        is NetworkStatus.Connected -> println("Connected to network")
        is NetworkStatus.Disconnected -> println("Disconnected from network")
    }
}
```

Or you can use the `Connectivity.updates` property, which is a `StateFlow<Connectivity.Update` that
emits a `Connectivity.Update` which contains the network status as well as whether the network
monitoring is active.

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity()
connectivity.start()
coroutineScope.launch {
  connectivity.updates.collect { update ->
    println("Monitoring is active: ${update.isMonitoring}")

    when (update.status) {
      is NetworkStatus.Connected -> println("Connected to network")
      is NetworkStatus.Disconnected -> println("Disconnected from network")
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Because the backing field for `Connectivity.updates` is a `StateFlow`, it requires a
initial value to be emitted. This means that the first value emitted will be the *real* current
network status. This is why the `isMonitoring` property is available on the `Connectivity.Update`.

By default when you construct a `Connectivity` object, it will not automatically start monitoring
network connectivity. You can enable this by passing in `ConnectivityOptions`():

### Options

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity {
    autoStart = true
}
```

You can start or stop monitoring network connectivity manually:

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity()
connectivity.start()

// At some later point
connectivity.stop()
```

The above `Connectivity()` function is a factory function provided by the platform-specific modules.
The `connectivity-core` module provides a factory function defined as:

```kotlin
fun Connectivity(
    provider: ConnectivityProvider,
    options: ConnectivityOptions = ConnectivityOptions(),
    scope: CoroutineScope = CoroutineScope(Dispatchers.Default),
): Connectivity
```

### HTTP monitoring

The `connectivity-http` module provides a way to monitor network connectivity by making HTTP
requests to specified urls. By default it will check connectivity
to `"google.com"`, `"github.com"`, and `"bing.com"` on port `443`. It will check for the first
successful response, and then update the status.

The network status is updated by polling the urls at a specified interval. The default interval is
5 minutes.

You can customize the HTTP monitoring like so:

**Note:** This is only available in the `connectivity-http` module.

```kotlin
val connectivity = Connectivity {
  urls("cloudflare.com", "my-own-domain.com") // Defaults to ["google.com", "github.com", "bing.com"]
  port = 80 // Defaults to 443
  pollingIntervalMs = 10.minutes // Defaults to 5 minutes
  timeoutMs = 5.seconds // Defaults to 2 seconds

  // Callback for when a poll is completed
  onPollResult { result ->
    when (result) {
      is PollResult.Error -> println("Poll error: ${result.error}")
      is PollResult.Response -> println("Poll http response: ${result.response}")
    }
  }
}
```

## Compose

Connectivity also provides support for Compose Multiplatform. To use it you will have to make sure
you add the dependencies for the `connectivity-compose-x` modules.

Then you can use it like so:

**Note:** This composable is provided by either `connectivity-compose-device`
or `connectivity-compose-http` artifact.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyApp() {
  val state = rememberConnectivityState {
    // Optional configurator for ConnectivityOptions
    autoStart = true
  }

  when (state.status) {
    is Connectivity.Status.Connected -> Text("Connected to network")
    is Connectivity.Status.Disconnected -> Text("Disconnected from network")
    else -> {}
  }
}
```

### Multiple Targets

If you need to support both Device and HTTP monitoring in the same project, you will have to do
something similar to [this](#all-supported-platforms).

Example:

```kotlin
// commonMain/Platform.kt
expect fun createConnectivity(): Connectivity
```

Then define the `actual` functions:

```kotlin
// deviceMain/Platform.device.kt
actual fun createConnectivityState(): Connectivity {
  return Connectivity {
    autoStart = true
  }
}

// httpMain/Platform.http.kt
actual fun createConnectivityState(): Connectivity {
  return Connectivity {
    autoStart = true
    urls("cloudflare.com", "my-own-domain.com")
    port = 80
    pollingIntervalMs = 10.minutes
    timeoutMs = 5.seconds
  }
}
```

Then it can be used like so:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyApp() {
  val state = createConnectivityState()

  when (state.status) {
    is Connectivity.Status.Connected -> Text("Connected to network")
    is Connectivity.Status.Disconnected -> Text("Disconnected from network")
    else -> {}
  }
}
```
